# Rainbow
This project is a Tensorflow 2.0 implementation of Rainbow (https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02298).

After the creation of DQN in 2013 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602) and there after the improvements in 2015 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602)
the peeps in DeepMind pooled together 7 improvements to the DQN from 2015.

The improvements include
* Double Q-learning - (https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461)
* Prioritized Experience Replay - (https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05952)
* Dueling network - (https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06581)
* Multi-step learning - (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00115009)
* Distributional RL - (https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06887)
* Noisy Nets - (https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.10295)

My reason for creating this project is to mimic the Rainbow paper as a basis in knowledge and code for my 
future academic pursuits in RL.
